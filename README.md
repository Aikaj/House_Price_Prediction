# House_Price_Prediction
Predict the house prices of Bangalore

I propose to implement a house price prediction model of Bangalore, India. Itâ€™s a Machine Learning project which integrates Data Science and Web Development. Housing prices fluctuate on a daily basis and are sometimes exaggerated rather than based on worth. The major focus of this project is on predicting home prices using genuine factors. Here, I intend to base an evaluation on every basic criterion that is taken into account when establishing the pricing. This project is a part of my training and internship in Data Analytics, Machine Learning and AI using Python at Diginique TechLabs.
